# currency-converter
Python script that parses input strings and uses exchange rate values from the fixer.io API to convert between GBP, USD, and EUR. This is a WIP version of a script that I plan on using in a bigger, later project.


For example, the following string:

    "I have $380, and your mom has $38"

can be parsed and return the following values:

    $380 USD is £245.64, €335.73
    $38 USD is £24.56, €33.57
